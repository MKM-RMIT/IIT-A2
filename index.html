                Overall, with a range of different learning styles for each member of the group, having a team of such different people is an advantage when working together. It allows for better communication and sharing of ideas that we would not be able to think of by ourselves.

              <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
              <h3>Blake's reflection</h3>
                <p>The team worked very well together, therefore we had many things go well. However, the consistent communication went well as we were always keeping each other updated and asked questions when we needed help. No team member was afraid to speak out when needed.</p>
                <p>Due to the teams’ tight schedule of their personal life, we sometimes were unable to all be available for meetings. Potentially in future projects a more scheduled and systematic system would benefit the team.</p>
                <p>Due to a rocky start and limited members being available it felt like the assignment progress was not going smoothly which left me worried for the outcome. However, when new members joined the team worked very well together and produced a great level of effort.</p>
                <p>It is most important to keep track of everyone’s progress and communicate. As if no one is 	communicating their progress the team doesn’t know if there’s a problem or if help is required.</p>
            <h3>John’s reflection </h3>
              <p>Working with the team on a group assignment was very pleasant, it was very similar to how I communicate and conduct meetings with my own team at work. All the active members were able to speak out their opinions and input their ideas for whatever we had. Weekly meetings were adhered to and if anyone was unable to attend, they would notify and discuss via the Teams channel. </p>
              <p>The biggest concern that I had was with the 2 members that did not communicate at all throughout the entirety of the assignment, nor did they reach out to work with us. Despite this unfortunate situation, as a team of 4 we did well. For future reference we should have more trackers in place to keep an eye on progress. </p>
            <h3>Mohammad's reflection</h3>
              <p>We named our group Team Basilisk which contained 4 members. I am honored to introduced with such group members and a great experience was recorded in my life memories. I hope that our collaboration continues for next steps. I am happy that we could do the tasks which was related to us in particular time and the reasons were hard working and division of the task for the relate person. I learned that hardworking and accepting each other are two important elements in a group work that fortunately we had.  

The only problem in start of our assignment was that was two of our group members were off and didn’t communicate with us and assignment needed lots of hard work and we needed more members but fortunately we could finish all of them by help of each other.</p>
              <h3>Maya’s reflection </h3>
              <p>Working in with Team Basilisk has been a pleasant experience. Everyone has made excellent use of our communication platforms and ensured that we were all on the same page every step of the way. I greatly value being able to see problems from the perspectives of my groupmates as well as my own. </p>
              <p>The high dropout rate of the Intro to IT subject made our first week as a group somewhat difficult, as it left us with only two members, and we had to quickly find new ones. Going forward in the future we will organise groups after potentially dangerous dates such as census day, so that we are not caught off guard by similar problems again. </p>
