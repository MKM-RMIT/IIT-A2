        <h1>Clouds, services, servers</h1>

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
        <p>Today cloud, services and servers are a technology which organisations are unable to ignore. Organisations world-wide are adapting their environment to fit with cloud computing services. Moving away from physical servers and integrating the use of cloud for their infrastructure, software, and deployment tools. Not only are these technologies being used in organisations, they are becoming increasingly popular for at home users, students and employees. Current trends for cloud computing and the services include Edge computing, serverless computing, hybrid environments and data democratization.</p>
        <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
        <p>IaaS</p>
        <p>‘Infrastructure as a Service’ provides an organisation an infrastructure over an internet connection, with services such as servers, storage and networking. Organisations utilising IaaS will see a cheaper alternative to purchasing hardware for each of these services, as well as only requiring payment for the exact amount of infrastructure needed. And importantly provides a less complex system to work with, as the organisation does not need to manage or setup a server from scratch when using an IaaS provider. Most commonly Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.</p>
        <p>PaaS</p>
        <p>‘Platform as a Service’ mainly strives to provide a platform which allows organisations to develop and deploy applications to their clients. Similar to IaaS, the system is easier to manage and setup through PaaS rather than using on-site hardware.</p>
        <p>SaaS</p>
        <p>‘Software as a Service’ is most used by many students, organisations, and at home users. As the service provides popular tools such as Office 365, Google Workspace and Dropbox. Similar to the other services the end users can access these tools anytime over the internet, meaning all the users’ data is synced between any device they use, and all the storage is managed and synced automatically.
        Companies such as Netflix also provide a SaaS for at home users for streaming television.</p>
        <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h3>
        <p>It is highly anticipated that the cloud and its services will continue to be a major component to organisations and homes all around the world. The impact of this means more organisations will move away from on-site servers, therefore more cloud storage will be required. As more organisations move away from physical servers, the domino affect continues as cloud services will begin to have an increase in competition naturally prices will begin to lower.</p>
        <p>As streaming services have successfully dominated the market with television, as the overall quality of home internet improves the possibility of streaming games via cloud services might be possible in the next three years.</p>
        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
        <p>The cloud and services are made possible with the development of providing services which include technologies such as, servers, networking, applications, storage and databases. One of the main development components that makes this possible is the access of all these services over the internet in a reliable state.
        For companies to make these services available they require a large scale of datacentres which are all properly configured to be online and stored appropriately to ensure all data is to be accessible to the users at a reliable rate.</p>

        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
        <p>Introducing cloud computing and services to organisations impacts their planning and management involved when dealing with an IT infrastructure, applications and deployment. Some of the outcomes of this includes lowering hardware costs, flexibility and scalability. This also means the elimination of physical servers and hardware needed.</p>
        <p>At home, families and friends will be impacted slightly differently. Daily life activities such as social media platforms storing all public data on the cloud, entertainment such as Netflix and Spotify having unlimited content available at any time and educational lessons and learning content stored in the cloud.</p>
        <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
        <p>The main aspect which will greatly change within the cloud, services and servers, is the management of physical on-site servers. As managing and buying these servers can be avoided by looking to services such as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Organisations will slowly migrate their environments and infrastructure to these services.</p>
        <p>Entertainment will continue to dominate with cloud services as they have been with streaming television. It is likely other industries such as video games will follow a similar path with games and storage being stored via the cloud rather than locally. Rather than having one copy of a video game or one save, your purchases and data will be available at anytime and anywhere.</p>
        <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
        <p>As organisations move their infrastructure and environment over to the cloud, employees will be affected the most as it is their job to ensure they are equipped with the skill set required to ensure this is possible. As many of these engineers and administrators will have never worked with these systems.</p>
        <p>However, for workers, they will be affected as well. As they begin to experience the shift in their environment, especially with SaaS. Moving to new technologies is not an easy task for non-IT workers and training will be required for many organizations.</p>
        <h3> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
        <p>As the engineers and administrators will be required to understand the cloud technologies this creates and replaces current jobs and technologies. Physical hardware will be replaced via the cloud service and the employees will be required to upskill their role accordingly. For those who are unable to adapt to the environment, it will be very difficult to find work in their industry the longer they wait.</p>

        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>SaaS alone largely affects my daily life. As this service provides an array of platforms and tools which change the way I am able to operate with study and work. As I am able to access data and content whenever I have access to a device which has access to the internet, such as a desktop, mobile, laptop and tablet. This is also true for platforms such as Office 365 which provide applications used for work and study.</p>
        <p>For work I am affected as in an environment which I have been taught to develop and manage physical servers, I am now tasked to learn the cloud services and platforms.</p>
        <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
        <p>Spending time setting up and managing hardware will no longer be required. This allows for more time towards other activities. This will create a difference on how I may plan the maintenance and support phase when working on a new project for a client. Less physical time required however, potentially more virtual support required.</p>
        <p>I will also have more flexibility when working at home, as access to work systems and servers will be more accessible. As before there was no possible way to access majority of servers from home.</p>
        <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
        <p>Similar to myself, the impact of my family and friends will greatly depend on the access to SaaS during work and study hours. For similar reasons, access to data whenever internet access is required is particularly useful for scenarios in which one may need to work or study from home. This environment could potentially have a positive or negative impact, as for those who adapt to the environment which they can work with these technologies will have find it easier adapting to work environments.</p>
