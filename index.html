                Overall, with a range of different learning styles for each member of the group, having a team of such different people is an advantage when working together. It allows for better communication and sharing of ideas that we would not be able to think of by ourselves.

              <h3>Blake's reflection</h3>
                <p>The team worked very well together, therefore we had many things go well. However, the consistent communication went well as we were always keeping each other updated and asked questions when we needed help. No team member was afraid to speak out when needed.</p>
                <p>Due to the teams’ tight schedule of their personal life, we sometimes were unable to all be available for meetings. Potentially in future projects a more scheduled and systematic system would benefit the team.</p>
                <p>Due to a rocky start and limited members being available it felt like the assignment progress was not going smoothly which left me worried for the outcome. However, when new members joined the team worked very well together and produced a great level of effort.</p>
                <p>It is most important to keep track of everyone’s progress and communicate. As if no one is 	communicating their progress the team doesn’t know if there’s a problem or if help is required.</p>
