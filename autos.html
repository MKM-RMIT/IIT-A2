        <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
        <p>To understand the current state of autonomous vehicles, we have to understand the levels of automatic vehicles. A clear way to understand the levels is to refer to the SAE standards, specifically SAE J3016 from SAE International (2022) which consists of 6 (0-5) levels that identify the capability of which the automatic vehicle can operate by. Level 0 being a vehicle which has no automatic features and requires the driver to have full control over the vehicle, and level 5 being a vehicle which can operate without any human interaction or control (SAE International, 2022).</p>
        <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
        <p>Currently the vast majority of new cars come with the capability of an autonomous vehicle which operates at level 1. Level 1 automation requires the driver to still have full control and attention to the vehicle and environment however, the features may include adaptive cruise control which keeps the car a safe distance from the closest car in front. As well as lane assistant, which warns the driver when nearing too close to the edge of a lane with a tug of the wheel.</p>
        <p>Further from level 1 vehicles, companies such as Tesla and Mercedes are beginning to release vehicles which have the option of level 2 features, such as full self-driving which gives the vehicle the ability to drive in a lane on its own, change lanes, turn corners and park. However, these vehicles are still only classified as level 2 as it is expected the driver is handling the wheel and staying engaged with the car and environment.</p>
        <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>
        <p>Currently in 2022, vehicle companies are beginning to develop and test level 3 automation. Angus Mackenzie (2022) had the opportunity to test the first level 3 vehicle demonstration with Mercedes, which is currently available for beta in Germany. The greatest differences between level 2 and 3, are the fundamental improvements. The autonomous steering, braking and accelerating, Mackenzie (2022) explains the autonomous experience as “more natural when driving itself”. Along with Mercedes other car manufactures will be working and developing solutions to release Level 3 automated vehicles, similar to level 2, these vehicles will be slowly distributed and only available at a premium price.</p>
        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
        <p>For a level 3 autonomous vehicle, there are many technologies that make the self-driving aspect possible. The following are some of the technologies.
        Computer power: Computing power includes items such as CPUs, GPUs and AI. CPUs and GPUs are used in the traditional sense however, an AI chip is used for a similar reason to the GPU however at a far larger cost. (Mbaabu, 2020)
        Cameras: Cameras in a level 3 autonomous vehicle act in which you may expect. To observe and react to the environments surroundings. The cameras capture information and feed the computing power. The cameras need to be made so that they are operatable in all environments such as wet and cold. (Mbaabu, 2020)
        Radar: When the conditions of the environment are difficult for a camera to capture, a radar is used to understand the distance between other objects (Mbaabu, 2020).
        Sensors: Sensors are installed to ensure the vehicle is capable of reacting to the surrounding such as pedestrians and other vehicles (Mbaabu, 2020).</p>

        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
        <p>The possible impact of autonomous vehicles is endless as it is still such early days. However, a few elements autonomous vehicles will likely impact is the time it takes to travel to a destination and resolving congested traffic in high density areas. The more people who are driving autonomous vehicles naturally create less congested roads, NHTS (2020) predict up to 50 minutes of travel time per driver will be reduced due to autonomous vehicles when the vehicles are fully automated.</p>
        <p>As well as improving travel times and congestion, autonomous vehicles provide the possible impact of increasing safety for drivers on the road. This is due to the fact once vehicles are fully autonomous, the human element is entirely removed. As this may be worrying for certain drivers, it does eliminate drink drivers, sleep deprived drivers and distracted drivers. (NHTS, 2020)</p>
        <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
        <p>As autonomous vehicles are manufactured to be run via electric rather than gas, this will likely result in creating an environment with better air pollution and lowering greenhouse gases. As well as trips likely being shorter, which will result in less cars on the road for a long period of time.</p>
        <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
        <p>The people who will be most affected from autonomous vehicles will likely be people which either are unable to afford and are not interested in purchasing an autonomous/electric vehicle. As the future is likely to increase manufacturing for autonomous vehicles and governments begin to slowly restrict the use of gas vehicles, people in which prefer to drive a car with an engine will have difficulties adjusting if it is ever enforced to drive an autonomous/electric vehicle.</p>
        <h3> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
        <p>Similar to the people which will be affected from autonomous vehicles, mechanics who specialize with traditional vehicles will face a large obstacle as their customers migrate to autonomous/electric vehicles. Since these vehicles will not contain an engine, traditional mechanics may struggle to adapt to the new technology.</p>

        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>With the likely chance roads will be consisted with majority autonomous vehicles one day, my daily life will be affected on common trips to destinations such as work. As I work in a highly congested city (Sydney), a life where the majority of cars are autonomous will mean less travel time will be needed to get to work, as well as the possibility of having access to other technologies when travelling such as emails and messages.</p>
        <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
        <p>Living in a world with majority autonomous vehicles will mean many elements of my life will be different. Some examples are as follows.
        Due to less time in a vehicle, I will have more time to focus on other activities. As this time will likely be minimal it won’t make a large difference to my day. However, I do see the possibility of having access to other material when driving such as emails, videos and messaging creating a difference, especially in an efficient manner for work.</p>
        <p>With increasingly expensive fuel prices, autonomous/electric vehicles can potentially create a more affordable method for travelling. As the vehicles will not be running from fuel, the use of at home electricity and supercharge stations as of now being free for use. This will create a difference in not only saving money, but also in how my time is used, no longer a requirement to go to a fuel station, as the car can be charged from home.</p>
        <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
        <p>Similar to myself, my family and friends will be affected in a way which may not feel very different when in the moment. However, the minor differences will affect all members which own and drive an autonomous vehicle. Due to the time that will be saved and the money that will be saved for owning an electric vehicle.</p>
