        <h1>Natural languge processing</h1>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h3>
        <p>State of the art natural language processing heavily overlaps with machine learning and frequently makes use of “transformer” architecture, (Wolf et al., 2019) allowing it to maintain attention without using sequence-aligned Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). (Kulshrestha, 2020) </p>
        <p>Some recent applications of natural language processing include expanding data-to-text generation to languages such as Turkish, (Demir, 2022) using it for social relationship analysis, to evaluate people’s interactions on social media (Anwar et al., 2022), and to analyse emotional context in news articles (Arbieu et al., 2021)</p>
        <h3>What can be done now? </h3>
        <p>Everyday natural language processing consists of applications such as machine translation, e.g. DeepL Translator (Wyndham, 2021), Google Translate (Google Translate, 2022), natural language generation, where data intended to be read by computers is translated into a human-readable format, optical character recognition (OCR) for digitising book scans, as well as aiding with accessibility, (IBM Cloud Education, 2022) (InclusiveDocs, 2022) digital assistants, also known as chatbots, text-to-speech, used in screen readers for people who are blind or otherwise visually impaired, and Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) for people who are nonverbal, (InclusiveDocs, 2022) and speech-to-text, which is the reverse and is used for applications such as automatic subtitling, a common feature of services hosting a high volume of user-generated content, e.g., YouTube, MS Teams. (Romero, 2022) </p>
        <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h3>
        <p>OCR will begin to be used on a much larger scale to assist with preserving history by transcribing scans of ship weather logs, letters, diaries, rather than relying on large volunteer efforts such as Zooniverse projects. </p>
        <p>The customer service workforce will continue to become more automated; using chatbots to handle simple enquiries, and to recognise when it is necessary for a human to deal with the customer’s problem. </p>
        <p>Real-time translation is already possible, where people’s voices are transcribed to text, translated, and then either re-created in auditory form via text to speech, or displayed as subtitles. (TechCrunch, 2022) In the future, this may become a widespread feature for events such as conferences, where people from a wide variety of backgrounds may be giving presentations in different languages. In the future, it may be possible to transcribe sign language via motion capture to text, and vice versa, combining NLP with CGI to translate from text to a sign language in order to teach people using sentences that would frequently occur in the real world, perhaps taken from a database consisting of literature that is now in the public domain. </p>
        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h3>
        <p>Machine learning could be used to train a neural network on a smaller subsection of a dataset of someone’s handwriting that has already been transcribed. Once this neural network has an acceptable accuracy rate, it can be used to analyse the entire dataset. </p>
        <p>Over time, machine learning models learn, hence the name. Chatbots will only become better at interaction over time, as they are trained by every interaction they have. </p>
        <p>Real-time motion capture already is possible and is widely used online by digital entertainers known as “VTubers” in order to translate their real-world actions to an animated 3D avatar. (What Is a VTuber?, 2022)</p>
        
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development? </h3>
        <p>There are many positive aspects to automating customer services, as it means employees will be less overworked, employees will be exposed to belligerent and abusive customers less often, customers will not have to wait for a human to become available to be served and consequently will leave better reviews of the business. The negative aspect is that many people will be replaced by chatbots and will need to find other work. </p>
        <p>Using OCR to transcribe historical documents is significantly faster than using volunteer transcribers, which can take years to complete transcription of a database. This will give historians greater freedom to access and make discoveries about the past. </p>
        <p>Improving sign language learning resources will allow more people to communicate easily with each other. </p>
        <h3>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? </h3>
        <p>Increasing chatbot usage in customer service will chiefly affect customer service employees and customers by decreasing workload and increasing customer satisfaction, secondarily affecting the profits of businesses as a result of the effects on the former two demographics.  </p>
        <p>With better resources, sign language may become a more widely taught language in schools. </p>
        <p>OCR could be used to create large searchable databases of historical texts, making research significantly easier. This would be most relevant for historians, but useful for anyone interested in the subject. </p>
        <h3>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
        <p>Machine-learning assisted OCR will largely replace most volunteer and professional transcribers. </p>
        <p>A rise in chatbot usage in customer service will cause a sharp decrease in the demand for human employees in that field of work, while also increasing the demand for IT professionals capable of maintaining chatbots. </p>
        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h3>
        <p>As a former volunteer transcriber, the author’s transcription ability will be significantly less important. As a polyglot with a keen interest in being able to interact with a diverse range of people, improving language learning resources would be very positive for the author, and automating customer service will reduce the amount of time the author spends on hold during phone calls. </p>
        <h3>What will be different for you? </h3>
        <p>Languages are easiest to learn when used regularly for practical situations. Sites like Duolingo are currently inadequate for learning sign languages, as they are entirely text based, and while this would allow a learner to practice interpreting signs, they would not get feedback on their own signing ability. As the author has not participated in transcription projects for a significant amount of time, there will be no significant change here. </p>
        <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
        <p>For friends of the author or members of the author’s family who share similar interests, the effects will be much the same. Those who do not engage in similar activities will not be greatly affected. </p>
