As companies are starting to rely heavily on applications for a lot of business processes the demand for application support managers are growing and are expected to grow with the increased use of SaaS.</p>

        <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
        <p>The specific skills required are skills which are in high demand. similar to reasons outlined within the ideal jobs, these skills are in high demand due to the rate which the industry is increasing. The ability to code and create websites are required for the outlined jobs, and these skills are not easily obtained. Due to the effort required and the complexity in which some jobs roles require, such as the IT application support manager.</p>
        <p>As well as coding, security awareness skill sets are in high demand for when understanding current industry standard and regulations as this is a specific skill required in each respective industry, when working in a public organisation the security standards and regulations will vary when comparing to a role within the defence force. Meaning, the level of knowledge required is not obtainable easily and requires having a reasonable amount of time spent in the industry. Which can be difficult when the role is in such high demand.</p>

        <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
        <p>The general skills required differ from the specific skills. The general skills required are less demanding. This is due to the skills being ‘general’, skills such as good communication and critical thinking aren’t just required for ICT roles, they are an expectation. Employers require employees who are adaptable and have a critical outlook of their role. However, ensuring that the employee masters the generic skills is something which is important to ensure no job opportunity is missed due to lack of capability.</p>

        <li><p>Advanced networking</p></li>
        <li><p>AI and machine learning</p></li>
        <li><p>Data analysis</p></li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
