        <h1>Machine learning</h1>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h3>
        <p>Cutting edge machine learning discoveries span a variety of fields, from medicine to cybersecurity. In the medical field, a brain-computer interface (BCI) uses machine learning to allow people to paint on a computer screen via intense concentration on colours and shapes. This is used to supplement traditional medical approaches for managing ADHD, reducing patients’ dependence on stimulant-based medications such as Adderall. (Parker, 2022) Researchers at Tohoku University in Japan developed a deep learning model capable of detecting eye diseases such as glaucoma and haemorrhages from images of the retina. This model does not require a large or particularly noise-free training dataset. (The Engineer, 2022) </p>
        <p>Machine learning is used in side-channel attacks to make use of leaked data, in one case successfully guessing 94% of the time what sites a Mac user on the Google Chrome web browser is accessing by analysing the length and frequency of system interrupts. An unintentional consequence of using machine learning is the obfuscation of the algorithm developed by the neural network, making it extremely hard for anyone to understand how it functions. (Zewe, 2022) (Cook, Drean, Behrens and Yan, 2022) This greatly benefits those who design and execute attacks, as it is nigh-impossible to counter an attack until it is understood. </p>
        <p>Another implementation of machine learning data analysis detects the presence of xylene from sensor data. Unlike typical methods, this approach does not rely on chromatography and can detect xylene in a mixed atmospheric environment. (American Chemical Society, 2022) </p>
        <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning implementations that are being used by the general public as of writing include the following. AIVA, an artificial intelligence capable of creating nuanced and emotional soundtracks, either taking influence from an uploaded human-composed midi file, or a preset genre. (TED Conferences, 2018) While AIVA has yet to play a notable role in soundtrack production for media, it is commercially available to the general public. </p>
        <p>DeepL is a translation service that uses machine learning, making it “well disposed to grasping the sense of the sentence rather than being led astray by a literal translation.” (Wyndham, 2021) In blind tests where it was compared against other translation services, DeepL was the preferred translator by a ratio of 3:1. (La Repubblica, 2020) </p>
        <p>Pinterest is a social media website that focuses on image sharing. It uses machine learning in order to recognise similar images to those its users have previously expressed interest in. These images are then recommended to its users, so that they may evaluate and “pin” them to their collections. (Zaratti, 2021) Using machine learning to provide users with more relevant recommendations likely helps with userbase growth and retention. </p>
        <h2>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h2>
        <p>Machine learning will begin to contribute more heavily to protecting human health by improving workplace safety and assisting with identifying the causes of medical problems.</p>
        <p>Combining tools such as AIVA with similar models designed for visual art may assist with the storyboarding process for creative media. By decreasing the time needed to create prototypes of music and visuals, a director can afford to try more approaches to their work in order to find one that works best. </p>
        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h3>
        <p>The lightweight model developed for screening eye disease does not require significant computational power and can be run on mobile devices. (The Engineer, 2022) It is the author’s belief that it is reasonable to assume that similar lightweight models will be developed in the future for other applications of machine learning, allowing it to be widely accessible instead of gatekept behind massive funding requirements to build and operate it.</p>
        <p>Computing power available to the public is increasing at an exponential rate. Real-time photorealistic raytracing is already possible with some graphical processing units. (GPUs) While lightweight models assist with getting technology into the hands of the public faster, eventually it may not be an absolute requirement. </p>
        
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning becoming more accessible means that more people will be able to become proficient with it and implement any ideas they may have. This will accelerate the development of the field. </p>
<p>Being able to easily detect dangerous gasses such as xylene may help with the diagnosis and treatment of those affected, as it grants medical professionals more information about the patient, as well as protect first responders from hazardous environments. </p>
<p>Automating parts of diagnostic tests means that patients may get their results back far sooner than when diagnosis is dependent on the time and expertise of a human.</p>

<h3>What is likely to change? </h3>

<p>While computers can be cloned easily, humans cannot, and training competent medical specialists takes years. This creates long waiting lists for patients trying to get the help they need. Including machine learning models as a part of diagnosis will reduce the time it takes for patients to get results. </p>

<h3>Which people will be most affected and how? </h3>

<p>The greatest impact will be on medical patients. For diseases such as cancer where early discovery and treatment is a vital part of survival rates, shortening those lists will save lives. Decreasing the amount of time they spend in a stressful and/or painful situation will also improve the ability of patients to recover from disease. </p>

<h3>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h3>

<p>The role of most medical professionals is not solely to run a single test for a patient. Their wide knowledge base is necessary to use the results of tests in the proper context and form an effective treatment plan. Additionally, while machine learning models can analyse the results of tests, they cannot yet run the tests themselves, therefore this technology should not replace any jobs. </p>

<p>Lab technicians who will work with machine learning models will need to be familiar with IT. Companies providing machine learning-based diagnostic services to clinics will have a need for technical writers to document their software in a way that is accessible to laymen, thus creating more jobs in this area. </p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
<h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different? </h3>
<p>Paradoxically, the most significant effect will be a reduction in effects. In the future, visiting a doctor for any reason will become much simpler, less stressful, and take up less time.</p>
<p>Introducing more complex technical solutions to more fields creates more jobs, as people who are familiar with such technology are needed to maintain its functionality. The author will have more diverse opportunities in the future to work and learn as a result. </p>
<h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
<p>Faster diagnosis and treatment would contribute significantly to the quality of life experienced by older friends and family members of the author, and perhaps help prevent hospitalisation. </p>
