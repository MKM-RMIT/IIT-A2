        <h1>IT Work</h1>
<p>We interviewed Jeremy Mora, a major incident manager at Quantas IT. The transcript for the interview can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/MKM-RMIT/IIT-A2/blob/main/Group%20Meeting%20Transcript.vtt">here.</a></p>

<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>

<p>As a major incident manager, Mr. Mora deals with any IT incidents that have high urgency or high impact that will affect business. This ranges from major network outages, to checking systems, to issues with inflight coms (ground to air coms.)</p>

<h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h2>

<p>Major incidents managers do not usually interact with the general public, however they do frequently interact with the staff that handle the general public in order to log incidents, as well as investors and stakeholders. </p>

<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>

<p>Most of Mr. Moraâ€™s time is spent in an Integrated Operation Center. Whenever an incident occurs, such as a major system going down, he is notified by a duty manager. </p>

<h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>

<p>Major incident management requires that service be restored to the public as soon as possible. Finding the root cause of a problem is challenging and can involve multiple teams working together in conference calls to identify the problem so that the outage does not occur again in the future. </p>
