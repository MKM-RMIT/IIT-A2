Hi, Jeremy. Thank you for taking

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/130-0
00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.786
I just have a few questions with
for you regarding your IT

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/130-1
00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.279
profession. Let's start off
simple. Tell us a bit about

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/130-2
00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.025
yourself. What is your role?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-0
00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:26.211
I'm gonna use Jeremy Mora. I'm a
major incident manager over at

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-1
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.178
Qantas site was a part of the
Qantas Service Center initially

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-2
00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:33.889
as a senior service desk
analyst, but they've moved on to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-3
00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.664

role my couple years after I

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-4
00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:41.760
started with them. So basically
I'm in charge of all the P ones

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-5
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.471
that come through for quarters
it globally. It's a global

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-6
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:49.374

incident management sector to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-7
00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:52.701
look after any critical
incidents that could affect

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/213-8
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:53.405
operations.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/218-0
00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.695
Brand image loss of revenue,
etcetera.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/239-0
00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:02.506
Alright. And could, could you
just elaborate a little bit what

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/239-1
00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:05.965
does major incident entail for
your position there?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-0
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:09.450
Yeah, of course. So our major
incident management, basically

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-1
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.108
any critical incidents that have
high priority, high impact, high

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-2
00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:18.202
urgency, it basically gets
escalated to myself. We have a

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-3
00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:22.648
Direct Line for major incidents
for Qantas it globally because

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-4
00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:27.306
we are international airline and
we have a lot of pubs across the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-5
00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:31.611
globe. So we operate out of an
IOC and Integrated Operations

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/301-6
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.105
Center.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/334-0
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:37.119
Which is the 24 by 7 four
located at Corners HQ in mascot

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/334-1
00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.490
and anything from major network
outages to checking systems to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/334-2
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.155
inflight Coms on grounds land to
Air Coms.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/363-0
00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:49.900
Uh. Anything I say. It basically
gets through to us. It's gonna

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/363-1
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.102
have an impact on the business.
Yes, we need to know about it

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/363-2
00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:56.201
and get troubleshooting and work
on a resolution as soon as

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/363-3
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:56.665
possible.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/366-0
00:01:57.775 --> 00:01:59.065
OK and.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/380-0
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:03.255
And what what made you want to
get into an IT profession?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-0
00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:08.146
I grew up with computers. I was
lucky enough to, you know, go

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-1
00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:11.708
through the 95 to 98 to the X
days. So I'll you know,

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-2
00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:15.865
computers have always been, you
know, big passion of mine. The

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-3
00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:19.757
other passion was obviously
aviation. Aviation has been in

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-4
00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:24.111
my family for a bit. It did work
in the airport for some time and

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-5
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.202
got trained up on some systems
that way. So as an end user, I

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/445-6
00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:29.125
went into the.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/461-0
00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.856
He service uh disposition with,
you know, pretty big

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/461-1
00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:35.345
understanding of how the
ecosystem works.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/488-0
00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:39.118
Umm. And yeah, obviously, you
know, throw computers into the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/488-1
00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:42.551
mix and you know, I was kind of,
you know, those really good spot

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/488-2
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:43.695
and what I like to do.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/506-0
00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:50.935
Thank you for that. What is it
to you? Ohh is general.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/516-0
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.819
I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of
course. You know, for an

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/516-1
00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.675
airline, it's quite critical.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-0
00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:59.123
Umm, you know, we got a lot of
IT on planes these days. It's

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-1
00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:03.197
not just fuel and propellers
anymore, whether it be in flight

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-2
00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:07.073
entertainment units, as I said
to land and air cons, it is

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-3
00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:10.424
basically the glue holding
holding the the overall

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-4
00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:14.432
operation of quantas together.
Yeah, you have we have a hard

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/580-5
00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:17.125
time when it goes down, that's
for sure.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/581-0
00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:18.235
Yeah, for sure.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/606-0
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:23.024
I have a few questions here from
some of my group members who are

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/606-1
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:26.263
unfortunately unable to make it
to our session. I'll share my

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/606-2
00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:28.875
screen and I'll play their
questions out for you.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/611-0
00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.375
Sure, no problems.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/619-0
00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.505
Just bear with me, Jeremy. IT
issues.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/621-0
00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:55.665
OK.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/624-0
00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:57.815
Playing the question.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/636-0
00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:02.133
Alright, my name is Mike. I have
two questions that I'd like to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/636-1
00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:02.355
ask.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/658-0
00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:07.067
What demographics do you usually
interact with as part of your

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/658-1
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:11.052
job, such as clients, investors,
other IT professionals, or the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/658-2
00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:11.985
general public?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/663-0
00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:14.695
Let's start with that question.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-0
00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:18.638
Awesome. Thank you for the
question. Maya. The demographic,

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-1
00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:22.169
yeah, obviously been in the
aviation industry, you know it's

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-2
00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.294
it's near far and wide. So
anything and everything in

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-3
00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:28.998
between in terms of the general
public, major incident managers

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-4
00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:32.645
don't tend to interact with the
general members of the public.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-5
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:36.349
It's more so staff that face the
customers, they'll call up and

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-6
00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.169
log those incidents with us over
the phone. I hope desk will then

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/740-7
00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.815
pass that information onto the
major incident management team.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/787-0
00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:48.668
Yeah. So we do have, you know,
lots of stakeholders and

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/787-1
00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:52.822
investors come through the ISYNC
Integrated Operations Center.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/787-2
00:04:52.822 --> 00:04:57.042
Qantas does regular tours of how
we work and how we operate. So

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/787-3
00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:00.800
yeah, my demographic would be
quite wide in terms of our

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/787-4
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.635
workers, our clients and our
stakeholders.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/794-0
00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.495
Thank you. And the second part
of the question here.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/805-0
00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:13.205
And what aspect of the IT field
do you find most challenging?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/813-0
00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:15.775
Thank you very much for your
time.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/809-0
00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:14.755
Yeah.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/846-0
00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:19.988
Motor problem. Miles. Another
great question. Umm. So yeah,

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/846-1
00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:23.241
obviously being in the major
incident management space, you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/846-2
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:26.657
know P ones. The main aim of the
game is to restore service as

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/846-3
00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:27.795
promptly as possible.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-0
00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:32.520
But also after the fact, you
know restoring service is great,

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-1
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.979
but you know we always need to
find the root cause and conduct

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-2
00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.999
and root cause analysis with
several service partners,

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-3
00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.294
whether it be you know on site
teams or offshore teams, you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-4
00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:45.589
know we we all get into great
big great big conference call

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-5
00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.158
and we try and smash it out just
to see what what went wrong. So

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-6
00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:52.288
we can amend the system or
systems. So we don't have any

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/923-7
00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:53.715
further outages in future.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/924-0
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:55.775
Wonder.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/926-0
00:05:55.845 --> 00:05:56.115
Ohh.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/938-0
00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:01.913
I have a couple more questions
here from Blake. Let me play

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/938-1
00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:02.705
them for you.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/940-0
00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:03.525
Sure.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/944-0
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:08.565
How do you keep your head?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/962-0
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:13.374
Hello, my name is Blake. I have
two questions. Firstly, how do

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/962-1
00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.915
you keep your technology skills
up to date?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/978-0
00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:22.163
Thank you for that question,
Blake. Yeah, look, definitely AU

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/978-1
00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:22.965
set set sets.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/987-0
00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:29.465
Always encourage you know your
Microsoft sets Cisco sets.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-0
00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:35.683
ITIL ITIL was probably one of
the best studying courses that I

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-1
00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:39.834
could have done in terms of IT.
I'm not sure if it's on a 12

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-2
00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:43.985
month or 24 month renewal basis
but the certification you do

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-3
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:48.273
need a refresher every 12 to 24
months. Don't quote me on that

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-4
00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:52.016
but yeah, ITIL M service
generally the main I stick to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-5
00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:56.371
but you can never have too many
certifications when it comes to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1060-6
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:58.685
it so the more the merrier I
say.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1088-0
00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:03.817
And the second part of the
question from Blake here and can

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1088-1
00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:06.876
you think of a time you were
asked before my task that you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1088-2
00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:09.936
didn't understand? If so, how
did you handle it? Thanks so

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1088-3
00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:10.195
much.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1098-0
00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:14.535
Ohh, that's a bit of a tricky
one. Ohh look.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1101-0
00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:17.225
Ohh with the.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-0
00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:21.922
Quantity spectrum of things you
know, we cover a lot of

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-1
00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:25.839
applications it's over 3000
applications that we service we

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-2
00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:29.692
don't we're not expected to
memorize you know all of it we

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-3
00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:33.479
have in depth Knowledge base
article with quick reference

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-4
00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.331
guys service instructions do
help us stay refreshed on the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-5
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:41.575
not so familiar systems in terms
of scenario where I've not been

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-6
00:07:41.575 --> 00:07:45.427
too sure look any P1 could
basically come with that you'll

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-7
00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:49.149
have a system that's been
working fine for 12 months and

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1171-8
00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.475
then.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1210-0
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:52.692
One day just decides to drop
off, so again recalls analysis

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1210-1
00:07:52.692 --> 00:07:55.841
with, you know, multiple service
partners. It's always a it's

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1210-2
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:58.888
always, you know, good to get
everyone in the same room and

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1210-3
00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:02.087
have it run on the same page to
try and investigate and get to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1210-4
00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:03.915
the get to the bottom of the
calls.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1215-0
00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:06.655
That's a great answer, Jeremy.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1230-0
00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:11.302
Uh, expanding on that, they. How
did you get your position? What

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1230-1
00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:13.835
experience do you have in the
industry?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-0
00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:18.076
Yep. So as I said previously,
you know, I grew up with

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-1
00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:22.181
computers, you know, not not
developer level. You know basic

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-2
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:26.151
end user interface. I I was
lucky enough to, you know work

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-3
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.122
in the airport as a checking
agent for 5:00 or so years to

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-4
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:34.159
kind of, you know, gain an idea
of what kind of systems are

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1292-5
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.985
used, how they're used and why
they used.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1305-0
00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:41.340
And obviously looking on seek,
you know, for any positions

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1305-1
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:41.895
available.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1306-0
00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:42.765
Special.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-0
00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.906
Going into that interview,
obviously I've showcased my

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-1
00:08:45.906 --> 00:08:49.016
knowledge, you know, of the
airport and the systems and you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-2
00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:52.230
know how everything works as a,
as a kind of ecosystem there.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-3
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.391
And you know, definitely helps
to know, know your know, your

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-4
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:58.242
surroundings, know your
environment and just know what

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1353-5
00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:00.315
type of workplace should be
going into.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-0
00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:05.488
Wonderful. And my final question
for you, Jeremy, would be where

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-1
00:09:05.488 --> 00:09:09.200
do you as an IT professional
spend most of your time, are you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-2
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.793
are you is most of your time
doing that root analysis check

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-3
00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:16.446
trying to solve a priority one
priority two issue or are you

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-4
00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:19.619
spending most of your time
discussing with customers

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-5
00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:23.272
whether that be the stakeholders
or the clients employees as

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1416-6
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:26.625
you've mentioned, where do you
spend most of your time?

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-0
00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:29.498
So yeah, look nice to my time is
spending that IOC, the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-1
00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:32.634
integrated Operation Center.
They actually have a duty

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-2
00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:36.054
manager. That's the head of
Qantas operations that's always

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-3
00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:39.760
on shift. It's a 24 by 7 floor.
So essentially that's that's the

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-4
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.295
help. That's where anything and
everything OPS goes down. The

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-5
00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:47.000
duty manager will let me know if
there's a major system and gone

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-6
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.649
down before all looking at the
call. So yeah, it's good to have

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-7
00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.298
them there. It's good to be on
the same page and have that very

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1503-8
00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:56.635
flat hierarchy of communication
between.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1509-0
00:09:56.725 --> 00:09:58.235
Between quarters and and myself.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1540-0
00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:03.311
Perfect. Look, uh, I wanna thank
you again, Jeremy, for taking

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1540-1

interview with me. You've been

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1540-2
00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:09.682
very helpful and it's giving me
an insight of what you do at

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1540-3
00:10:09.682 --> 00:10:11.275
Qantas. It sounds very hectic.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1555-0
00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:15.196
But thank you so much for taking
your time to go through this

Cheers mate. Bye bye.

392036a3-0dbf-4838-b312-616af426dfdb/1584-0
